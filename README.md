What This Does
@st.cache_resource Decorator:

Tells Streamlit to cache the result of this function

Only runs the function once, even if the script reruns

Ideal for expensive operations like loading documents or creating vector stores

The initialize_rag() Function:

Contains all your initialization code (document loading, splitting, vector DB creation)

Returns your fully configured rag_chain2

How It Works:

First run: Executes the full initialization

Subsequent runs: Returns the cached result instead of recomputing

Why This Is Better
Performance:

Avoids redundant processing of PDFs and vectorization

Makes your app respond faster to user queries

Resource Efficiency:

Doesn't recreate the vector store in memory

Key Improvements:
Caching:

@st.cache_resource for API key loading

@st.cache_resource for the entire RAG system initialization

Organization:

Better separation of concerns

Clear function boundaries

Error Handling:

More graceful error messages

User Experience:

Better exit handling

Clearer interface

Performance:

Only initializes heavy components once

Reuses vector store between queries

This version maintains all your original functionality while being more efficient and robust. The RAG system will only initialize once when the app starts, and subsequent queries will reuse the cached components.

Reduces CPU/GPU usage

Cleaner Code:

Clearly separates initialization from interaction logic

Makes it obvious what parts should only run once
